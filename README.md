# Word-Counter
The Word Counter application goes through a file and counts the number of each word, finds the longest word and sorts the word according to the number of their occurences in descending order, as well as sorting them alphabetically.
When the program starts, it will prompt the user to enter a filename. "FoxInSocks.txt" is the file provided for testing this application.
