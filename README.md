# Word-Counter
<p align="justify">The Word Counter application goes through a file and counts the number of each word, finds the longest word and sorts out the words either alphabetically, or according to the number of their occurences in descending order.<br>
When the program starts, it prompts the user to enter a filename. "FoxInSocks.txt" is the file provided for testing this application.</p>
